2. [Open a CLA Signature Request](https://github.com/cortexlinux/cortex/issues/new?template=cla-signature.yml)
3. Fill out the form and submit
4. A maintainer will add you to the signers list
5. Comment `recheck` on your PR to re-verify

Once signed, all your future PRs will pass CLA verification automatically.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before contributing, ensure you have:

- **Python 3.10+** installed
- **Git** for version control
- A **GitHub account**
- An API key (Anthropic or OpenAI) for testing

### Quick Start

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/cortex.git
   cd cortex
   ```
3. **Set up development environment** (see below)
4. **Create a branch** for your changes
5. **Make your changes** and test them
6. **Submit a Pull Request**

---

## Development Setup

### Complete Setup

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/cortex.git
cd cortex

# Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/cortexlinux/cortex.git

# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Install in development mode
pip install -e .

# Run tests to verify setup
pytest tests/ -v
```

### Requirements Files

If `requirements-dev.txt` doesn't exist, install these manually:

```bash
pip install pytest pytest-cov pytest-mock black pylint mypy bandit
```

### IDE Setup

## Code Style Guide

### Python Style

We follow **PEP 8** with some modifications:

```python
# Use 4 spaces for indentation (not tabs)
# Line length: 100 characters max

# Use snake_case for functions and variables
def calculate_dependencies(package_name: str) -> List[str]:
    pass

# Use PascalCase for classes
class InstallationCoordinator:
    pass

# Use UPPER_CASE for constants
MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS = 3
DEFAULT_TIMEOUT = 300
```

### Docstrings

Use Google-style docstrings:

```python
def install_package(
    package_name: str,
    dry_run: bool = False,
    timeout: int = 300
) -> InstallationResult:
    """Install a package using the appropriate package manager.

    Args:
        package_name: Name of the package to install.
        dry_run: If True, show commands without executing.
        timeout: Maximum time in seconds for installation.

    Returns:
        InstallationResult containing success status and details.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If package_name is empty.
        TimeoutError: If installation exceeds timeout.
    """
    pass
```

### Type Hints

Always use type hints:

```python
from typing import List, Dict, Optional

def parse_request(
    request: str,
    context: Optional[Dict[str, str]] = None
) -> List[str]:
    pass
```

### Formatting

Use **black** for formatting:

```bash
black cortex/ --check  # Check formatting
black cortex/          # Format all files
```

---

## Testing Guidelines

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest tests/ -v

# Run with coverage
pytest tests/ --cov=cortex --cov-report=html

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_cli.py -v
```

### Coverage Requirements

- **New code:** Must have >80% coverage
- **Overall project:** Target 70% minimum
- **Critical modules:** Target 90%+
